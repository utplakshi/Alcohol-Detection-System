Project Motivation/ Description:
India holds the world record in the number of road accidents annually, according to a report released by the WHO in 2010. Around 1,34,000 people die every year in India on account of road accidents. The most shocking fact is that 70% of these are due to the consumption of alcohol, according to a report released in 2011. With my project, “Alcohol detection System”, I intend on preventing these accidents. This project also provided the much-required exposure and experience required by working with microcontrollers, as well by coding and understanding the working of such systems.
